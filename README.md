# ABOUT THE DATASET
Education is one of the most critical aspects of personal and societal development, and understanding factors that influence academic performance is essential. This analysis examines a dataset on student performance to uncover patterns, behaviors, and key drivers of success. The dataset is visualized using MongoDB Charts to derive actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and stakeholders.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information on factors influencing student performance, including:  
- Academic Metrics: Exam scores, attendance, and previous scores offer measurable indicators of student achievement.  
- Demographics: Gender, school type, and parental education levels provide insights into trends across various student groups.  
- Study Habits: Variables such as hours studied, sleep hours, and tutoring sessions shed light on routines and their impact.  
- Support Systems: Access to resources, internet connectivity, and parental involvement highlight the external factors influencing outcomes.  
- Behavioral and Environmental Factors: Motivation levels, peer influence, and physical activity offer a glimpse into the psychological and social contributors to academic performance.
